# FindTheFirstMissingPositiveInteger
I crafted this efficient algorithm that solved this test

// Rami Al-Saadi 2022 
// My 100% performance 100% correctness efficient algorithm/solution to solve the coding test found at: https://app.codility.com/c/run/demoP9WWQW-UE3/
// The challenge is to write a function that, given an array of integers returns the smallest positive integer that does not exist in the array.
// But the algorithm has to be efficient and high performing.
// For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], the function should return 4.
// Given A = [1, 2, 3, 4], the function should return 5.
// Given A = [-1, -6], the function should return 1.

// function solution takes parameter A as the array to be processed and searched for the smallest positive number(if it exists),
// otherwise -if no positive integer is found- the function would return 1 since 1 is the smallest positive integer.
