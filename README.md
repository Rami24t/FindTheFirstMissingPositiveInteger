#### My 100% performance 100% correctness efficient algorithm/solution to solve the coding test found at: https://app.codility.com/c/run/demoP9WWQW-UE3/

### The challenge/test 
The challenge is to write a function that, given an array of integers returns the smallest positive integer that does not exist in the array.

But the algorithm has to be efficient and high performing.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 1, 2], the function should return 4.
Given [1, 2, 3, 4], the function should return 5.
Given [-1, -6], the function should return 1.
Given [], the function should return 1.
Given [1, 2, 3, -5, 5, 6, 7, 4, 8, 9, 10, - 1, 0] , the function should return 11.
Given [1, 2, 3, -5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, - 1, 0] , the function should return 4.
Given [-4,-3,-2,-1,0] , the function should return 1.

My function solution takes parameter A as the array to be processed and searched for the smallest positive number(if it exists),
otherwise -if no positive integer is found- the function would return 1 as 1 is the smallest positive integer.
